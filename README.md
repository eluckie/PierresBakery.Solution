# Pierre's Bakery

#### By E. Luckie ☀️

#### This C# console application acts as an ordering medium for a faux bakery. Upon program start, users are shown how much each bakery item costs, including sale prices. They're then able to input how many of each item they want and have their order total displayed back to them.
